### Safety Gear Detection Sample

The Safety Gear Detection Sample is another demonstration of the powerful capabilities of the Intel® Distribution of the OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform object detection. The sample presents a video frame-by-frame to the Inference Engine (IE) which subsequently uses an optimized trained neural network, mobilenet-ssd, to detect people and their safety gear. This public model is a mobilenet neural network (SSD – Single Shot MultiBox Detector framework) that has been pre-trained to detect objects in a video clip.
