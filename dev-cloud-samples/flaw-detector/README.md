### Flaw Detector Sample

The Flaw Detector Sample introduces development with Jupyter* Notebook. The reference sample demonstrates how to use a notebook instance to run inference on a pre-recorded video featuring a series of objects moving on a conveyor belt. Using OpenCV for inference, the sample detects objects and produces an output video indicating the manufacturing flaws.

With this reference sample, developers play the output video directly in the notebook instance to see the results.
