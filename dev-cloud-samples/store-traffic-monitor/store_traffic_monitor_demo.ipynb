    "# Store Traffic Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "Store traffic manager is an advanced use-case example, it builds on the two previous examples illustrated and shows how a user can deal with multiple videos and perform object detection and inference on all of these simultaneously.In this use-case, the application monitors the activity of people inside and outside an imaginary store front as well as keeps track of product inventory using a pre-trained neural network for detection. This application is capable of detecting objects on any number of screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo assumes you have already tried the object detector sample. If you have not done so already, we recommend going through that sample first to understand the workflow for developing a deep-learning example using OpenVINO. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information on using the traffic monitor, as well as the original source code can be found on github:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the implementation here has been slightly modified to work on IoT DevCloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of How it works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The counter uses the Inference Engine included in the OpenVINO™ toolkit. A trained neural network detects objects within a designated area by displaying a green bounding box over them. This reference implementation identifies multiple intruding objects entering the frame and identifies their class, count, and time entered. \n",
    "\n",
    "At start-up the sample application reads the equivalent of command line arguments and loads a network and image from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. A job is submitted to the hardware accelerator (Intel® Core CPU, Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Xeon CPU, Intel® Movidius™ and/or Neural Compute Stick). After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results directory which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Video as input is supported using **OpenCV**\n",
    "* Inference performed actual Edge hardware\n",
    "* **OpenCV** provides the bounding boxes, labels and other information\n",
    "* Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes\n",
    "* Demonstrate the Async API in action"
